# Sorting-Viusaliser
A program that visualises different sorting Algorithms. 
To run the program make sure all the .pde files are saved in the same folder. Also note the different font usages throughout the code
Please install the font of your choice and added to a folder accordingly and adjust it in the required sections of the code.
I have added the fonts and images I used in the requiredFiles folder.
